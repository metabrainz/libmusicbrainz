 Installation of the MusicBrainz Client Library
================================================

The instructions in this file should help you to build and install the
MusicBrainz client library from source on your system.

Dependencies
============

Before you start, make sure you have installed following libraries:

 * Neon -- HTTP client library
   http://www.webdav.org/neon/

Building
========

Once you have installed all dependencies, you can compile the
library:

   cmake .
   make

And to install the built library run (as root):

   make install

CMake Options
=============

By default, the library will be installed to /usr/local. You can change this
using the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX option, for example:

   cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr .

To disable debug messages, change the build type:

   cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .

For overview of all available options use:

   cmake -L .

or use a GUI. See http://www.cmake.org/HTML/RunningCMake.html for more details.
